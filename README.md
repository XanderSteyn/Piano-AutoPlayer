2. **Song Notes** : The script reads the notes from the second line onward. Each note is then sent as a key press with the defined delay between them.
3. **Visualizer** : A progress bar shows the current position of the song, which is updated as the song plays.
4. **Playback Control** : Press **F4** to start playback. Press **F8** to pause or resume the playback.

## üìÇ Example Song Files

Feel free to use the provided song text files, or create your own! The files should be structured like this :

```
200
[8yuo] w t u t w 8 w t u t w
[8s] w [th] u t [ws]
[0a] r [yh] o y [rh]
[qj] t [ih] p [ig] t
[0h] t o t [oj] [tk]
```

Where the first line is the key delay (200 in this case) and the following lines are the notes.
